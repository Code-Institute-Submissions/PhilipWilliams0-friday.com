## User Experience (UX)

-   ### Project goals
This site is aimed at teams who want a free resource that will help them in their workday. It is also a site where users can share their projects with other departments. 

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to know about the site. 
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily create an account. 
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to log a project.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find information about projects.

        3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to edit or delete an project. 


    -   #### Frequent User Goals
        1. As a Frequent User, I want to able to change the status.
        1. As a Frequent User, I want to able to see my own projects. 

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are Code Insititue purple, blue, and white.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the strong structure provides stability and seriousness.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.
    -   #### Data Schema

        -   Using MongoDB provides many benefits in the development of this app. Its flexible schema makes it easy to evolve and store data in a way that is easy to work with. MongoDB is also built to scale up quickly and supports all the main features of modern databases such as transactions.

5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://github.com) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/PhilipWilliams0/friday.com
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/PhilipWilliams0/friday.com

## Create MongoDB database
My data was stored in a [MongoDB](https://cloud.mongodb.com/) collection set up using the following steps.
- Sign up / Sign In to mongodb and create a new cluster.
- Select 'collections' from the cluster dashboard.
- Click 'create database', and create database name and collection name.
- Click 'create collection' for any additional data collections needed for the app.

## Create Flask Application and install pymongo
In the terminal type the following commands to install the required packages:
    
- The following command will install the packages according to the configuration file
    ```
    $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

Setup app
- Create `app.py` and `env.py` using the terminal
    ```
    touch app.py
    touch env.py
    ```

- Create gitignore file using the terminal to keep `env.py `from being pushed to github
    ```
    touch env.py
    ```

- Within the gitignore file add `env.py` and `__pycache__/`.
    ```
    env.py
    __pycache__/
    ```

Set up environment variables and flask instance
- Within `env.py` add the following environment variables:

    ```
    os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
    os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
    os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "YOUR SECRET KEY")
    os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "YOUR MONGO URI")
    os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "YOUR DATABASE NAME")
    ```

    - I used [randomkeygen]() to generate my secret key. 
    - To get your mongodb URI, go to your cluster dashboard and hit connect. Select your version of python and copy the string to the clipboard.

## Setting up the heroku app
In order to deploy the app via [heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps), the following steps must be taken. 

- In the terminal, create requirements.txt and Procfile for Heroku to run correctly
    ```
    pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
    ```
    ```
    echo web: python app.py > Procfile
    ```
- Push your files to gitHub
- Navigate to [heroku](https://heroku.com/) and create a new app in your dashboard.
- Assign an app name and region and hit 'create app'.
- In your dashboard, click to connect your gitHub and then locate the correct repository to be deployed.
- Click on the settings tab and then click 'reveal config vars' in order to input the data hidden in `env.py` as follows.
        
        IP                  0.0.0.0
        MONGO.DBNAME        friday-project
        MONGO_URI           MONGO URI copied from env.py
        PORT                5000
        SECRET_KEY          SECRET_KEY copied from env.py

- Click 'enable automatic deploy' in the app dashboard.
- Click view to see the deployed site!
